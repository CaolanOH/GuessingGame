# GuessingGame
Simple guessing game to explore OO from headfirst Java

# Summary
The guessing game involves multiple objects. The 'game object' and three 'player' objects. The game generates a random number between 0 and 9. The three player objects try to guess it. A bit boring but it shows objects calling methods on each other.
